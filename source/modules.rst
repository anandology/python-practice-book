Modules
=======

Modules are reusable libraries of code in Python. Python comes with many standard library modules. 

A module is imported using the `import` statement. 

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import time
    >>> print time.asctime()
    'Fri Mar 30 12:59:21 2012'
    
In this example, we've imported the `time` module and called the `asctime` 
function from that module, which returns current time as a string.

There is also another way to use the import statement.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from time import asctime
    >>> asctime()
    'Fri Mar 30 13:01:37 2012'
    
Here were imported just the `asctime` function from the `time` module. 

The `pydoc` command provides help on any module or a function.

.. code-block:: text

    $ pydoc time
    Help on module time:

    NAME
        time - This module provides various functions to manipulate time values.
    ...
    
    $ pydoc time.asctime
    Help on built-in function asctime in time:
    
    time.asctime = asctime(...)
        asctime([tuple]) -> string
    ...
    
On Windows, the `pydoc` command is not available. The work-around is to use, the built-in `help` function.

.. code-block:: text

    >>> help('time')
    Help on module time:
    
    NAME
        time - This module provides various functions to manipulate time values.
    ...

Writing our own modules is very simple.

For example, create a file called `num.py` with the following content.

.. code-block:: python

    def square(x):
        return x * x
        
    def cube(x):
        return x * x * x
        
Now open Python interterter:

    >>> import num
    >>> num.square(3)
    9
    >>> num.cube(3)
    27

Thats all we've written a python library. 

Try `pydoc num` (`pydoc.bat numbers` on Windows) to see documentation for this numbers modules. It won't have any documentation as we haven't providied anything yet.

In Python, it is possible to associate documentation for each module, function using docstrings. Docstrings are strings written at the top of the module or at the beginning of a function.

Lets try to document our `num` module by changing the contents of `num.py`

.. code-block:: python

    """The num module provides utilties to work on numbers.
    
    Current it provides square and cube.
    """
    
    def square(x):
        """Computes square of a number."""
        return x * x

    def cube(x):
        """Computes cube of a number."""
        return x * x
        
The pydoc command will now show us the doumentation nicely formatted.

.. code-block:: text

    Help on module num:

    NAME
        num - The num module provides utilties to work on numbers.

    FILE
        /Users/anand/num.py

    DESCRIPTION
        Current it provides square and cube.

    FUNCTIONS
        cube(x)
            Computes cube of a number.
    
        square(x)
            Computes square of a number.

Under the hood, python stores the documentation as a special field called `__doc__`.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import os
    >>> print os.getcwd.__doc__
    getcwd() -> path

    Return a string representing the current working directory.

Standard Library
----------------

Python comes with many standard library modules. Lets look at some of the most commonly used ones.

os module
^^^^^^^^^

The `os` and `os.path` modules provides functionality to work with files, directories etc.


.. problem:: Write a program to list all files in the given directory. 


.. problem:: Write a program `extcount.py` to count number of files for each
   extension in the given directory. The program should take a directory name
    as argument and print count and extension for each available file extension.

.. code-block:: text

    $ python extcount.py src/
    14 py
    4 txt
    1 csv

.. problem:: Write a program to list all the files in the given directory along
   with their length and last modification time. The output should contain one
   line for each file containing filename, length and modification date separated
   by tabs.

   Hint: see help for ``os.stat``.

.. problem:: Write a program to print directory tree. The program should take
   path of a directory as argument and print all the files in it recursively as
   a tree.

.. code-block:: text

    $ python dirtree.py foo
    foo
    |-- a.txt
    |-- b.txt
    |-- code
    |   |-- a.py
    |   |-- b.py
    |   |-- docs
    |   |   |-- a.txt
    |   |   \-- b.txt
    |   \-- x.py
    \-- z.txt


urllib module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `urllib` module provides functionality to download webpages.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import urllib
    >>> response = urllib.urlopen("http://python.org/")
    >>> print response.headers

    X-Pad: avoid browser bug

    >>> response.header['Content-Type']
    'text/html'
    
    >>> content = request.read()
    
.. problem:: Write a program wget.py to download a given URL. The program should accept a URL as argument, download it and save it with the basename of the URL. If the URL ends with a /, consider the basename as index.html.

.. code-block:: text

     $ python wget.py http://docs.python.org/tutorial/interpreter.html
     saving http://docs.python.org/tutorial/interpreter.html as interpreter.html.

     $ python wget.py http://docs.python.org/tutorial/
     saving http://docs.python.org/tutorial/ as index.html.

re module
^^^^^^^^^

.. problem:: Write a program antihtml.py that takes a URL as argument, downloads the html from web and print it after stripping html tags.

.. code-block:: text

    $ python antihtml.py index.html
    ...
    The Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python on
    those machines where it is available; putting /usr/local/bin in your
    ...

.. problem:: Write a function `make_slug` that takes a name converts it into a slug. A slug is a string where spaces and special characters are replaced by a hyphen, typically used to create blog post URL from post title. It should also make sure there are no more than one hyphen in any place and there are no hyphens at the biginning and end of the slug.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> make_slug("hello world")
    'hello-world'
    >>> make_slug("hello  world!")
    'hello-world'
    >>> make_slug(" --hello-  world--")
    'hello-world'

.. problem:: Write a program `links.py` that takes URL of a webpage as argument
   and prints all the URLs linked from that webpage.

.. problem:: Write a regular expression to validate a phone number.

json module
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. problem:: Write a program myip.py to print the external IP address of the
   machine. Use the response from ``http://httpbin.org/get`` and read the IP
   address from there. The program should print only the IP address and nothing
   else.
     
zipfile module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `zipfile` module provides interface to read and write zip files.

Here are some examples to demonstate the power of zipfile module.

The following example prints names of all the files in a zip archive.

.. code-block:: python

    import zipfile
    z = zipfile.ZipFile("a.zip")
    for name in z.namelist():
        print name

The following example prints each file in the zip archive.    

.. code-block:: python

    import zipfile
    z = zipfile.ZipFile("a.zip")
    for name in z.namelist():
        print
        print "FILE:", name
        print
        print z.read(name)
        
.. problem:: Write a python program `zip.py` to create a zip file. The program should take name of zip file as first argument and files to add as rest of the arguments.

.. code-block:: text

    $ python zip.py foo.zip file1.txt file2.txt    


.. problem:: Write a program `mydoc.py` to implement the functionality of pydoc. The program should take the module name as argument and print documentation for the module and each of the functions defined in that module.

.. code-block:: text

    $ python mydoc.py os
    Help on module os:
    
    DESCRIPTION
    
    os - OS routines for Mac, NT, or Posix depending on what system we're on.
    ...
    
    FUNCTIONS
    
    getcwd()
        ...
        
Hints:
    * The `dir` function to get all entries of a module
    * The `inspect.isfunction` function can be used to test if given object is a function
    * `x.__doc__` gives the docstring for x.
    * The `__import__` function can be used to import a module by name

Installing third-party modules
------------------------------

PyPI, The Python Package Index maintains the list of Python packages available. The third-party module developers usually register at PyPI and uploads their packages there.

The standard way to installing a python module is using `pip` or `easy_install`. Pip is more modern and perferred.

Lets start with installing `easy_install`.

* Download the easy_install install script `ez_setup.py <http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py>`_.
* Run it using Python.

That will install ``easy_install``, the script used to install third-party python packages.

Before installing new packages, lets understand how to manage virtual environments for installing python packages. 

Earlier the only way of installing python packages was system wide. When used this way, packages installed for one project can conflict with other and create trouble. So people invented a way to create isolated Python environment to install packages. This tool is called `virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_.

To install ``virtualenv``:

    $ easy_install virtualenv
    
Installing virtualenv also installs the `pip` command, a better replace for `easy_install`.

Once it is installed, create a new virtual env by running the ``virtualenv`` command.

.. code-block:: text

    $ virtualenv testenv
    
Now to switch to that env.

On UNIX/Mac OS X:

.. code-block:: text

    $ source testenv/bin/activate

On Windows:

.. code-block:: text

    > testenv\Scripts\activate
    
Now the virtualenv `testenv` is activated.

Now all the packages installed will be limited to this virtualenv. Lets try to install a third-party package.

.. code-block:: text

    $ pip install tablib

This installs a third-party library called ``tablib``.

The ``tablib`` library is a small little library to work with tabular data and write csv and Excel files.

Here is a simple example.

.. code-block:: python

    # create a dataset
    data = tablib.Dataset()

    # Add rows
    data.append(["A", 1])
    data.append(["B", 2])
    data.append(["C", 3])
    
    # save as csv
    with open('test.csv', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(data.csv)

    # save as Excel
    with open('test.xls', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(data.xls)

    # save as Excel 07+
    with open('test.xlsx', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(data.xlsx)

It is even possible to create multi-sheet excel files.

.. code-block:: python

    sheet1 = tablib.Dataset()
    sheet1.append(["A1", 1])
    sheet1.append(["A2", 2])

    sheet2 = tablib.Dataset()
    sheet2.append(["B1", 1])
    sheet2.append(["B2", 2])
    
    
    book = tablib.Databook([data1, data2])
    with open('book.xlsx', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(book.xlsx)

.. problem:: Write a program ``csv2xls.py`` that reads a csv file and exports
   it as Excel file. The program should take two arguments. The name of the csv
   file to read as first argument and the name of the Excel file to write as the
   second argument. 

.. code-block: text

    $ python csv2xls.py a.csv a.xls

.. problem:: Create a new virtualenv and install BeautifulSoup. BeautifulSoup
   is very good library for parsing HTML. Try using it to extract all HTML
   links from a webpage.
