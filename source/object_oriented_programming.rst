State
=====

Suppose we want to model a bank account with support for ``deposit`` and ``withdraw`` operations. One way to do that is by using global state as shown in the following example.

.. code-block:: python
 
    balance = 0

    def deposit(amount):
        global balance
        balance += amount
        return balance

    def withdraw(amount):
        global balance
        balance -= amount
        return balance

The above example is good enough only if we want to have just a single account. Things start getting complicated if want to model multiple accounts.

We can solve the problem by making the state local, probably by using a dictionary to store the state. 

.. code-block:: python

    def make_account():
        return {'balance': 0}
        
    def deposit(account, amount):
        account['balance'] += amount
        return account['balance']

    def withdraw(account, amount):
        account['balance'] -= amount
        return account['balance']

With this it is possible to work with multiple accounts at the same time. 

.. code-block:: python

    >>> a = make_account()
    >>> b = make_account()
    >>> deposit(a, 100)
    100
    >>> deposit(b, 50)
    50
    >>> withdraw(b, 10)
    40
    >>> withdraw(a, 10)
    90

Classes and Objects
===================

.. code-block:: python

    class BankAccount:
        def __init__(self):
            self.balance = 0
            
        def withdraw(self, amount):
            self.balance -= amount
            return self.balance
            
        def deposit(self, amount):
            self.balance += amount
            return self.balance

    >>> a = BankAccount()
    >>> b = BankAccount()
    >>> a.deposit(100)
    100
    >>> b.deposit(50)
    50
    >>> b.withdraw(10)
    40
    >>> a.withdraw(10)
    90

Inheritance
===========
 
Let us try to create a little more sophisticated account type where the account holder has to maintain a pre-determined minimum balance. 

.. code-block:: python

    class MinimumBalanceAccount(BankAccount):
        def __init__(self, minimum_balance):
            BankAccount.__init__(self)
            self.minimum_balance = minimum_balance
            
        def withdraw(self, amount):
            if self.balance - amount < self.minimum_balance:
                print 'Sorry, minimum balance must be maintained.'
            else:
                BankAccount.withdraw(self, amount)

.. problem :: What will the output of the following program.

.. code-block:: python

    class A:
        def f(self): 
            return self.g()

        def g(self):
            return 'A'

    class B(A):
        def g(self): 
            return 'B'

    a = A()
    b = B()
    print a.f(), b.f()
    print a.g(), b.g()

**Example: Drawing Shapes**

.. code-block:: python

    class Canvas:
        def __init__(self, width, height):
            self.width = width
            self.height = height
            self.data = [[' '] * width for i in range(height)]
            
        def setpixel(self, row, col):
            self.data[row][col] = '*'
            
        def getpixel(self, row, col):
            return self.data[row][col]
            
        def display(self):
            print "\n".join(["".join(row) for row in self.data])

    class Shape:
        def paint(self, canvas): pass
        
    class Rectangle(Shape):
        def __init__(self, x, y, w, h):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y
            self.w = w
            self.h = h
        
        def hline(self, x, y, w):
            pass
            
        def vline(self, x, y, h):
            pass
            
        def paint(self, canvas):
            hline(self.x, self.y, self.w)
            hline(self.x, self.y + self.h, self.w)
            vline(self.x, self.y, self.h)
            vline(self.x + self.w, self.y, self.h)

    class Square(Rectangle):
        def __init__(self, x, y, size):
            Rectangle.__init__(self, x, y, size, size)

    class CompoundShape(Shape):
        def __init__(self, shapes):
            self.shapes = shapes

        def paint(self, canvas):
            for s in self.shapes:
                s.paint(canvas)

Special Class Methods
=====================

In Python, a class can implement certain operations that are invoked by special syntax (such as arithmetic operations or subscripting and slicing) by defining methods with special names. 
This is Python's approach to operator overloading, allowing classes to define their own behavior with respect to language operators.

For example, the ``+`` operator invokes ``__add__`` method. 

.. code-block:: python

    >>> a, b = 1, 2
    >>> a + b
    3
    >>> a.__add__(b)
    3
    
Just like ``__add__`` is called for ``+`` operator, ``__sub__``, ``__mul__`` and ``__div__`` methods are called for ``-``, ``*``, and ``/`` operators.

**Example: Rational Numbers**

Suppose we want to do arithmetic with rational numbers. We want to be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide them and to test whether two rational numbers are equal.

We can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and test equality by using the following relations::

    n1/d1 + n2/d2 = (n1*d2 + n2*d1)/(d1*d2)
    n1/d1 - n2/d2 = (n1*d2 - n2*d1)/(d1*d2)
    n1/d1 * n2/d2 = (n1*n2)/(d1*d2)
    (n1/d1) / (n2/d2) = (n1*d2)/(d1*n2)
    
    n1/d1 == n2/d2 if and only if n1*d2 == n2*d1

Lets write the rational number class.

.. code-block:: python

    class RationalNumber:
        """
        Rational Numbers with support for arthmetic operations.
    
            >>> a = RationalNumber(1, 2)
            >>> b = RationalNumber(1, 3)
            >>> a + b
            5/6
            >>> a - b
            1/6
            >>> a * b
            1/6
            >>> a/b
            3/2
        """
        def __init__(self, numerator, denominator=1):
            self.n = numerator
            self.d = denominator
        
        def __add__(self, other):
            if not isinstance(other, RationalNumber):
                other = RationalNumber(other)
            
            n = self.n * other.d + self.d * other.n
            d = self.d * other.d
            return RationalNumber(n, d)
            
        def __sub__(self, other):
            if not isinstance(other, RationalNumber):
                other = RationalNumber(other)
            
            n1, d1 = self.n, self.d
            n2, d2 = other.n, other.d                
            return RationalNumber(n1*d2 - n2*d1, d1*d2)
        
        def __mul__(self, other):
            if not isinstance(other, RationalNumber):
                other = RationalNumber(other)
            
            n1, d1 = self.n, self.d
            n2, d2 = other.n, other.d                
            return RationalNumber(n1*n2, d1*d2)
        
        def __div__(self, other):
            if not isinstance(other, RationalNumber):
                other = RationalNumber(other)
            
            n1, d1 = self.n, self.d
            n2, d2 = other.n, other.d                
            return RationalNumber(n1*d2, d1*n2)
        
        def __str__(self):
            return "%s/%s" % (self.n, self.d)

        __repr__ = __str__

Errors and Exceptions
=====================

We've already seen exceptions in various places. Python gives ``NameError`` 
when we try to use a variable that is not defined.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> foo
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    NameError: name 'foo' is not defined
    
try adding a string to an integer:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> "foo" + 2
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects

try dividing a number by 0:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> 2/0
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
    
or, try opening a file that is not there:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> open("not-there.txt")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'not-there.txt'
    
Python raises exception in case errors. We can write programs to handle such 
errors. We too can raise exceptions when an error case in encountered.

Exceptions are handled by using the try-except statements.

.. code-block:: python

    def main():
        filename = sys.argv[1]
        try:
            for row in parse_csv(filename):
                print row
        except IOError:
            print >> sys.stderr, "The given file doesn't exist: ", filename
            sys.exit(1)

This above example prints an error message and exits with an error status when an IOError is encountered.

The `except` statement can be written in multiple ways:

.. code-block:: python

    # catch all exceptions
    try:
        ...
    except:
    
    # catch just one exception
    try:
        ...
    except IOError:
        ...
    
    # catch one exception, but provide the exception object
    try:
        ...
    except IOError, e:
        ...

    # catch more than one exception
    try:
        ...
    except (IOError, ValueError), e:
        ...

It is possible to have more than one `except` statements with one `try`.

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        ...
    except IOError, e:
        print >> sys.stderr, "Unable to open the file (%s): %s" % (str(e), filename)
        sys.exit(1)
    except FormatError, e:
        print >> sys.stderr, "File is badly formatted (%s): %s" % (str(e), filename)

The `try` statement can have an optional `else` clause, which is 
executed only if no exception is raised in the try-block.

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        ...
    except IOError, e:
        print >> sys.stderr, "Unable to open the file (%s): %s" % (str(e), filename)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print "successfully opened the file", filename

There can be an optional `finally` clause with a `try` statement, which is executed 
irrespective of whether or not exception has occured.

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        ...
    except IOError, e:
        print >> sys.stderr, "Unable to open the file (%s): %s" % (str(e), filename)
        sys.exit(1)
    finally:
        delete_temp_files()
        
Exception is raised using the raised keyword.

.. code-block:: python

    raise Exception("error message")
    
All the exceptions are extended from the built-in `Exception` class.

    class ParseError(Exception):
        pass
